			<p>I struggle putting Pile into words without using strange metaphors: They sound like a man falling from the top of the Empire State 			Building and landing safely on his feet only to get run over by a car; they’re a guitar band that doesn’t sound like a guitar band; there’s something intense and brave about them, but it feels feminine, not macho, not over the top. I don’t feel good at explaining what Pile sounds like.</p>

<p> Pile is Rick, bassist Matt Connery, drummer Kris Kuss, and guitarist Matt Becker. They are from Boston, and they have a reputation as your favorite band’s favorite band. I have an email about Pile from Amar Lal, the guitarist of Big Ups. I’ve asked him four questions, and he answers “What do you love about Pile?” the best.</p>

<p>“The music, the people in the band, and the community of Pile-lovers,” he writes. “More specifically: their mastery of extreme dynamics, the way the drop-tuned guitars resonate with you in just the right way, the melodic and harmonic turns that you never expect but always feel right, the feeling of extreme release that I get from listening to Pile and yelling the words I still don’t know, getting drunk and watching videos of leopards tripping on drugs in the jungle with Connery, embarrassing ‘Rick from Pile,’ Kris’s continuous grin and bear hugs and unparalleled manliness and professionalism, Becker’s guitar face and late-night conversations about life, meeting someone halfway across the country and mentioning Pile and knowing that they just ‘get it,’ and smiling and being speechless with a group of people after what I’ve heard described as the ‘religious and transcendental experience’ of seeing Pile live.”</p>

			<p>“Everything is Fine” is perhaps the most fitting title that Alaska could have chosen for their debut full length. It is a title with a litany of meanings when applied to this body of work by Nevada post-hardcore/whatever locals Alaska. In one regard it is a mantra that one should repeat to themselves at certain points throughout the duration of this LP. Whenever things become seemingly too chaotic or disjointed, or the vocals too grating or unrecognizable just close your eyes, lean back, and repeat it to yourself.</p>

<p>“Everything is fine…everything is fine…everything is fine.”</p>

<p>Sink into that mantra and let the music briskly take you past whatever part it is that ails you and very soon afterwards you will be once again in the thick of a record full of many, many things to love and only a few parts not executed well enough to digest effortlessly.  At ten songs that clock in at less than thirty minutes it’s an album that moves at a quick, fleeting pace that takes you on a journey through many different ideas rebranded on songs that sound eerily familiar but different enough to know you’re not stuck in the middle slump of something too long to be meaningful.</p>

<p>So here we have an album that is obviously filled with passion by a group of guys who put a lot of time and work into something they wanted to share with anyone who would listen. While there are some parts that fall short and weigh down the overall cohesiveness of the album it is easily something I can recommend to even the most hesitant of listeners. If at times you begin to struggle with Alaska’s debut full length just remember that they said it best, “Everything is Fine”.</p>

	<p>The songs on the second album by the Philadelphia band Hop Along seem to have come whirling out of a fairytale, visceral but ornate, outside reality but still scarred by it. Their energy comes from punk but their style comes from somewhere older and more obscure—a Victorian attic, maybe, or the kind of basement where the band’s singer Frances Quinlan got turned onto punk in the first place.</p>

<p>This was ten years ago or so. Quinlan had just graduated from high school and was touring around with a folk record influenced by playful, sharp-witted writers like Joanna Newsom and Kimya Dawson. The record, Freshman Year, felt cute and warm but took dark turns into the nightmare logic of children—one song, called "Bruno Is Orange", is sung from the perspective of a girl who fears that the government is going to put her friend in jail because the two of them kissed.</p>

<p>Eventually, Quinlan formed a band with her brother Mark and a bassist named Tyler Long and assumed a sound that filtered Quinlan’s storytelling through the rough, emotionally unguarded approach of bands like Rilo Kiley or Bright Eyes—bands who turned diary entries into anthems and vulnerability into a shuddering kind of power. Their first album, 2012’s Get Disowned, is a messy world where people stomp on old floorboards for percussion and saw violins like they were made of something stronger than wood. Everything is governed by Quinlan, who sings in the wild voice of someone casting out demons (or having the demon cast out of them). Its second song, "Tibetan Pop Stars", should be etched in titanium and shot into outer space for safekeeping.</p>

<p>Hailing from Chicago and its South Suburbs, and coming soon to you, the members of Ratboys have no qualms scurrying through the streets to meet up and make music. What started out as a spacey, acoustic two-piece playing secret shows in dorm rooms, has morphed into a post-country foursome that simply cannot deny the power of rodent rock. They recorded the first rat record, AOID, at The Owlery in Chicago and are now ready to put it all out there via Topshelf Records during this almighty year of 2k15. The folks in Ratboys find themselves addicted to the sensation of quiet growing into something bigger, and they can't wait to welcome you into it.</p>

<p>When Brooklyn Vegan premiered Ratboys‘ single “Tixis,” I was instantly intrigued. Never hearing of the band before, with “Tixis,” and an upcoming release via Topshelf Records, I knew Ratboys would be a band to watch. That upcoming LP, AOID, is now streaming via Culture Collide.</p>

<p>The band creates a wonderful medley of acoustic inspired indie rock layered with fuzz, melodic narrations, and hauntingly catchy melodies. While the band is catchy throughout, it’s moments like midway through “Charlie Bernstein” that truly show the band’s sonic chops. Guiding the listener through the incredibly catchy groove, halfway through the track the band releases an atmosphere like spilled nerves, going off on tangents from the original tightly-woven beginning.</p>

<p>With the warming weather and summer on the horizon, I hope to spin AOID a lot more in the future. Be sure to grab the record here. Follow us after the jump to stream the LP via Culture Collide, and to check out the band’s upcoming tour dates. See you in Boston?</p>
